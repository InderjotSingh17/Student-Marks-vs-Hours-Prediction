# 🎓 Student Marks vs Hours Prediction

This project uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict a student's marks based on the number of study hours. It is a supervised machine learning model that learns from historical data of hours studied and corresponding marks scored.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that:
- Takes number of study hours as input
- Predicts marks scored by the student
- Evaluates performance using regression metrics

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of two columns:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Hours | Number of hours studied |
| Scores | Marks obtained by the student |

Example:

| Hours | Scores |
|------|--------|
| 2.5 | 21 |
| 5.1 | 47 |
| 7.8 | 75 |
| 9.2 | 88 |

## 📌 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| MAE | 3.92 |
| MSE | 18.94 |
| RMSE | 4.35 |
| R² Score | 0.97 |

These results show the model is performing **very well**.
